- PWAs with Angular: Blurring the lines between native and web apps (Giorgos Kalpakas)

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are all the rage these days. In this presentation, we will explore what a PWA really is and why you should care.

We will look at the various building blocks and how they can be leveraged to provide a native-like user experience without sacrificing the reachability of web apps. We will discuss PWA-specific development and testing tools.

Finally, we will find out how easy it is to build a PWA with Angular and see an example in action.
